# real-time-bus-tracker

In the 9th week of MIT's Professional Certificate in Coding we learned about asynchronous code. This exercise was to take bus data from the MBTA and map the movement of buses along the bus route in realtime. This project uses Mapbox. 


## Installation

Upon cloning the files you'll need to get a personal key from Mapbox and copy-paste it in the "your Mapbox code here" section of the code. launch the HTML file in the browser of your choice. You'll be able to see the eyes following your mouse as you move it around the browser window. 

## Future Improvements

I would like to replicate this project for other bus routes and in other cities!
